<youlysses> Is there a automated way to convert my .odt documents to org-mode,
            and/or other documenting based services/languagus?
<tali713> hey, and many times there are aspects of the law were I would like
          more consistency.  like I think that corporations, being persons
          after all, should have to serve jail time and be unable to conduct
          business after accidentally killing thousands of people.  just like
          if I am drunk and hit a guy while driving a car.
<ijp> tali713: and liquor stores should not be allowed to sell alcohol until
      they have been in business 18/21 years :P                         [13:18]
<shergill> exactly. meaning either do away with the 'corporations are people'
           analogy entirely, or codify a better analogy.
<shergill> don't do neither, and rely on human discretion *every* time
<Frozenlock> tali713: Why the distinction between hitting someone with your
             car and hitting someone with your car while drunk?         [13:19]
<tali713> oh, nah, i'm in favor of metaphorically jailing them.  if you kill
          people being a corporation shouldn't mean, well it doesn't matter,
          here is a fine that's half of one days net profit.

<JordiGH> How does one pull a Ron Jeremy?
<Frozenlock> tali713: Taking alcohol increases the risk. However the risk
             variation isn't the same for everyone. Some are sober and
             represent the same risk as others who've taken some shots. Should
             driving for them also be criminal? How do you determine this? Can
             you universalize this principle? -> increase of risk = criminal?
<ijp> JordiGH: by the d**k                                              [13:25]

<fsbot> Ba-dum, *Ching!*
<tali713> Frozenlock: if they kill someone, yes.  end of story.         [13:26]
<Frozenlock> But until then, no, is that right?
<tali713> Frozenlock: their state of mind effects the nature of the killing,
          regardless, it is a killing.
<ijp> Frozenlock: you make guidelines about reasonable alcohol consumption
      based on expected average tolerance                               [13:27]
<Frozenlock> I agree. Which is why I don't see why whether or not they've
             taken alcohol should matter.
<tali713> Frozenlock: irrelevent to the case at hand.  I was using vehicular
          manslaughter as an example.  your driving ability is not at hand
          here.  your willful disregard for life is.

<tali713> Frozenlock: because it isn't vehicular murder if you didn't mean to
          kill the victim.  if you are drunk, odds are, it was an accident.
                                                                        [13:28]
<ned> punishing people for drunk driving is the equivalent of thoughtcrime 
<youlysses> Compaines are only "people" when they view it to be more
            preffrable to the law they must "adhere" to.
<ned> (i'm 80% joking, but somewhat serious)
<proq> what about search engine crime?                                  [13:29]
<ned> what's that? punishing people for looking up things that could
      potentially faciliate a crime?
<ijp> ned: okay, so how is reckless endangerment of others using heavy
      machinery a thoughtcrime?
<Frozenlock> tali713: Perhaps I misunderstood what you were saying, I thought
             you wanted a drunk driver to have different consequences than
             anybody else.
<tali713> Frozenlock: just like if you are are a drug company, and you decide
          that it is an acceptable risk to put an unsafe drug on the
          market. (by advertsining for a pupose other than what it was tested
          for), you aren't intending to kill people, it's just the consequence
          of the actions.
<ned> ijp: until you actually do some damage it's punishing people for
      potential damage rather than actual damage
<ijp> ned: the mere fact that you've actually got drunk, and got in a car, is
      an actual act                                                     [13:30]
*** pgega (~pgega@5ad7c217.bb.sky.com) has quit: Quit: Konversation

<ned> yes i agree with that but that act isn't inherently causing damage
<tali713> ned: the same argument could be made for headlights.
<offby1> when I say PATH=/some/dir:$PATH, is there an easy way to ensure that
         /some/dir doesn't also appear _later_ in $PATH?  I often find my PATH
         has multiple copies of directories, like
         /some/dir:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/some/dir:/usr/share/bin:/some/dir
         etc
<ned> tali713: and safety belts
<ned> actually, i withdraw the safety belt quip, that's not even remotely
      analogous                                                         [13:31]
*** julienfantin (Adium@nat/hackerschool.com/x-nzbzqynpkvjrxaqp) has quit:
    Quit: Leaving.
<tali713> ned: not really, the only people effected by safety belt usage is
          the occupent of the vehicle.  headlights are not just for you.
          driving in a predictible manner is not just for you.
<ned> yeah i withdrew that argument ;]                                  [13:32]
<tali713> yup, saw that.
*** jmd` (~user@de.cellform.com) has joined channel #emacs
<tali713> the thing is, you won't be arrested for driving drunk if you show no
          signs.  but if you do show highly erratic driving, and you are
          drunk, then your choice to get drunk and get in the vehicle is
          certainly a problem. (crime or not)                           [13:33]
*** kevinbenko (~kvirc@misterfluffy.dsl.xmission.com) has quit: Quit: KVIrc
    4.1.3 Equilibrium http://www.kvirc.net/
<ijp> ned: I could see how that would be an argument against checkpoints, but
      if you were noticed by a passing officer, they probably aren't going to
      stop you unless you are driving in an uncoordinated (and therefore
      dangerous) manner
<proq> Frozenlock: the drunk driving law is one of those cases where it
       doesn't really matter what an individual's opinion about the law is.
       it's other people's lives at stake, and disagreeing is pretty selfish
<ijp> ah, tali713 beat me to it
<Frozenlock> So don't drive at 20 km/h if you're drunk, it might be
             suspicious. Go at 50-60 km/h instead :P                    [13:34]
<ned> ijp: i support pulling people over for lane violations, erratic driving,
      and speeding regardless of whether or not theyre under the influence
<tali713> don't drive unsafely ever, and if your judgement is impaired (the
          first sign being that you are convinced your judgment is not
          impaired), then you can't drive safely, it requires reflexes you
          don't have.

<ijp> ned: okay, but you don't think that being under the influence should be
      a factor in deciding the appropriate punishment?                  [13:36]
<daveo> in some ways, a drunk driver killing someone (regardless of intent) is
        far worse than the the planned murder, the victum is not guilty of any
        offense                                                         [13:37]
<daveo> innocent bystander
<ijp> daveo: but the murdered person totally had it coming?
<shergill> daveo: what makes you think the victim has to be guilty of anything
           in planned murder?
<Frozenlock> proq: Don't associate law and preferable behavior. I would not
             drive drunk. I just think treating drunk driver differently is
             incoherent. (And the law should be coherent/understandable for
             Joe Sixpack to be able to follow it. Saying otherwise is pretty
             selfish ;-)  )
<tali713> ned: those aren't the bad part of drunk driving, those are the
          observable parts.  the lack of reaction time is the truly dangerous
          part.  you might be able to handle normal circumstances, but driving
          doesn't gaurentee those and you need to be able to react almost
          instantaniously.  I also think talking on a cellular is equivalent
          and should be punished equivalently.
<ned> ijp: you can't use being drunk as an excuse to justify your crime in
      defense in order to diminish the sentence issued post conviction. the
      converse should be true -- i.e., your punishment shouldn't be increased
<proq> Frozenlock: 38% of traffic fatalities in 2009 were from drunk driving
       accidents                                                        [13:38]
<ned> tali713: should you punish old people who have demonstratably lowered
      reaction times?
<Frozenlock> proq: How does that relate to what I've said?
<ijp> ned: there is a reason we make them retest more often
<tali713> ned: yes, by revoking their license, if you can't react fast enough
          to road conditions then you don't deserve the privilege of driving.
<ned> how do you objectively quantify who's 'fit to drive' ? id take a 25 year
      old who had 4 beers over 4 hours over a 95 year old on the road.
<proq> ned: old people have to retake the test, and eventually fail
<ned> i've never once heard of re-tests in the united states
<ned> ive lived in new york and massachusetts                           [13:39]
<ned> granted that's a tiny sample size
<ned> is this really common practice?
<tali713> yes the get quite frequent as you get old because of the reasons
          already mentioned.
<proq> Frozenlock: since when does it have to be an exact response to the last
       thing you said?
<Frozenlock> Proq: well ok then... I've eaten bacon for breakfast. Hmmmmm.
<tali713> ned: drunk driving is not about you, it is about everyone else on
          the road, driving is a privilege not a right.                 [13:40]

           reference)
<zellio> w0m: studies have shown a lot of things

<proq> zellio: the "majority" of the time there isn't a cop around observing

<tali713> ned: "I don't think i'm /that/ drunk."  "you are just saying that
          because your judgment is impaired."
<zellio> proq: driving tests should  be harder
<zellio> proq: and people should be retested more often
<w0m> I don't know anyone who got into an accident in thel ast ~4 years that a
      cellphone wasn't involved; including a couple serious ones
<zellio> proq: driver incompetance will come out no matter what
<ned> tali713: i was responding to w0m's cell phone remark
<tali713> ned: oic.

<fledermaus> ciao
<proq> ijp: yes, would you have to correlate the statistics with 1982 where
       drunk driving was 60% of all fatalities because more people were
       driving drunk, and it has been declining ever since

<daveo> ciao fledermaus 
<Frozenlock> proq: Suppose that we had statistics showing that men (or women)
             are worse drivers. Should we ban them from the street?
<ijp> Frozenlock: now you're just being ridiculous
<w0m> The study i recall; they setup an obstical course; and had people use a
      cellphone and run through it; to get a numerical score. They then had
      drunk people of varying levels (based on BAC) run the same course; and a
      sober person                                                      [13:45]
<w0m> (and a sober/normal person also)
<daveo> shergill: doesn't gnome-terminal != urxvt ?
<proq> zellio: that still would fail unless you figure out a way to test
       whether people can get easily distracted, and only when they don't
       *know* they're being tested
<ned> how is that ridiculous, he's being hyperbolic to get at a larger point--
      how do you objectively determine who a safe driver is and who isn't
<Frozenlock> ijp: Well If you can just find risk factor and use them to bend
             the law (pre-crime), then we must apply it. Think of the children
             for god sake!                                              [13:46]

      negligible

<shergill> daveo: yes. i'm talking of the display. i'm wondering why setting
           the same font and size is giving different appearance on the same
           machine
<ijp> that's like saying you shouldn't be allowed to drive if you've had a
      cold within the last 12 months since you might sneeze             [13:47]
<ned> he's saying 'suppose', so for the sake of argument if men were 20% more
      likely to get into fatal accidents with oncoming traffic, should they be
      banned from driving?
<wbooze> you should ban the boobs, they are attracting them!

<ijp> you made a few comments about how "it's thoughtcrime", posted scepticism
      at the thought of retesting, and made a bullshit defense Frozenlock's

<ijp> in your defense of frozenlock's argument
<ned> and which states retest ?
<ijp> I don't know, I'm not an american
<proq> let's backtrack
<futuro`> Does anyone know how to make cperl mode highlight scalar variables?
<futuro`> for example "$foo" isn't highlighted
<futuro`> but arrays, such as "@foo" are
<ijp> proq: to where?
<ned> < ijp> ned: there is a reason we make them retest more often
<ned> which countries retest old people then i suppose i should ask     [14:00]
<jlf> futuro`: with the point on $foo, what default face is shown when you do
      M-x customize-face RET ?

<tali713> futuro`: font-lock-add-keywords if it is isn't already highlighted
          (albeit invisibly)
<futuro`> 'all faces'*
<proq> ijp: I was making a double entendre.  backtrack is also a distro
<jlf> futuro`: hmm, that's surprising
<ijp> ned: there is talk of doing it in the UK, though we do not at present.
<futuro`> perl-mode shows 'font-lock-variable-name-face'
<futuro`> tali713: I'll look for that variable
<tali713> futuro`: it's not a variable, it's a function.
