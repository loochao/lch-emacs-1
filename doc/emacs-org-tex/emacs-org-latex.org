#+TITLE: My little document

* Introduction
  
  This is my document. There are many like it, but this is mine. It's easy to
  write without *too* _many_ /distractions/.
  
** Normal distribution

   Probability density of the normal distribution, using familiar TeX notation
   for formulae:
 
   $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} }$$
