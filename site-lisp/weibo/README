This is a Weibo client for EMACS.

Initialization:

1. Put .el files into a directory.

2. Make sure that directory is part of "load-path":
    (add-to-list 'load-path "path to directory")

Usage:
1. Load the weibo library:
     (require 'weibo)

2. It uses the EMACS built-in url-retrieve by default. To use curl
    instead:
     (setq oauth-use-curl t)

3. Authorization:
   - The first time you use the client(e.g., check the time line), you
     will be redirected to the Sina authorization page, where you can
     authorize this client and see a pin number.     
   - Input that pin number into the echo area in EMACS
    
4. Check your timeline:
     M-x weibo-timeline
